## Description

Learn how to weave a range of online technologies into engaging interactive experiences. In this course, students will learn the basics of web technologies that are fundamental to building an online presence for any design project. Students will learn how to identify the current technologies underlying social media interfaces, mobile web applications that rely on browsers and apps. You will also gain an understanding of the fundamentals of markup languages (HTML, XML) as well as formatting (CSS) and client-side programming (JS). These basic skills will be contextualized within a basic overview of interface design. With the knowledge built in this course students will begin to understand how to create responsive web-based projects that adapt to different devices and develop strategies for creating screen-based interfaces. Students with credit in GDEX-3B13 may not take this course for credit.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the appropriate use of web technologies.
2. Apply the current standard in web formatting and programming.
3. Integrate technologies from a variety of web-services.
4. Plan and execute the design of a basic web-based application.

## Supplies

You must bring your laptop to every class. There may be periods in the course when additional supplies will be requested or supplied.

## Student Preparation / Workload Expectations

You can anticipate that studying and completing class will require at a minimum 2–3 hours of time outside of class per week for every hour of in class time per week.

## Teaching & Learning Methods

Studio work, seminars and lectures provide the foundation of this course. Students are expected to work on weekly assignments, and larger, multi-week assignments. As well, students are expected to arrive in class having read articles and prepared to talk about them on the weeks that they are assigned. The course will be a balance of coding, form, concept and theory. Individual, small-group and class-wide critiques will take place on a weekly basis. Students are expected to provide input and support on their peers work. This course consists of 2 major assignments and 4 one-week assignments. Students are expected to make progress on long-term assignments each week and should be prepared to present their work from week-to-week.

## Class Schedule

OCAD U has a twelve-class semester followed by a two-week assessment period for exams and critiques. Students must be available for the duration of this period.

[See complete class schedule in README.md](./README.md#schedule)

## Critique / Exam Schedule

The Final Exam Schedule will be released by the office of the Registrar a few weeks after classes have started. This schedule will be sent to instructors and posted online on the [OCAD U website](http://www.ocadu.ca/).

Please also refer to [Senate Policy, 1019: Examinations](https://www.ocadu.ca/sites/default/files/legacy_assets/content/registrarial/1019%20Examinations%20Policy.pdf). This policy outlines the conditions under which a student may request a) a deferred examination and b) access to final examination materials.

Conflict exams must be reported to the Office of the Registrar within 15 working days after the Final Exam Schedule has been published. All requests for Deferred Final Exams due to medically documented and emergency issues must be requested through the Office of the Registrar. If you have a conflict between a critique and a scheduled exam, please contact your Faculty Office.

## Late Work

Late work is not acceptable except in the case of documented illness or extraordinary circumstances. Late work will not be accepted without prior permission of the faculty member. All late work will be assessed a minimum penalty of 20% per week. Even with prior permission, no late work will be accepted more than 7 days after the initial due date. Students may not re-submit previously graded work or work produced for other courses for evaluation.

## Participation

Participation is worth 10% of your final grade and is tallied based on attendance (unexcused absence = -4% of final grade), participation in in-class discussions and thoughtful feedback in critique.

## Grading Breakdown

Numerical grades may be translated into letter grades based upon the following scale:
