# Data Rivers, Streams, and Creeks

Using a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Application Programming Interface (API), construct a simple web-based experience based on data from an external JSON feed. Your website should gather information or content from an external source and manipulate in some way beyond simply re-posting it. A few considerations as you put together your page:

- Are there ways you use the data to manipulate elements (scale, colour, etc) in your DOM?
- Can you collect and frame content based on your own parameters?
- How do you account for variability in the content over time?
- What is a consistent element? How/When can it deviate?
- Each project should include a statement outlining what youâ€™re doing as well as your data source.

## An alternative to the above brief

Use external JS library(ies) to create a visually compelling web-poster. You are free to choose your content but know that you are being graded based on form, content, and execution. Example libraries you can include:
