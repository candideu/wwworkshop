    <h2>Twelfth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interactions</h2>

    <h3>March 18 â€“ 21, Stockholm, Sweden</h3>

    <p>TEI 2018 is the 12th annual conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. It will be held 18th to 21st March 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

    <p>This year the theme of the conference is <strong>Post-digital Design</strong>. In the early days of TEI, a common assumption was that our physical mundane reality could be augmented by sprinkling it with the magic of digital technology. Over the last decade there is less mystery to the realm of digital technologies as the digital have become the mundane, inseparable from our everyday routines. The digital is also increasingly distrusted and challenged in various ways, as the divisive creator of filter bubbles and the breading ground of alternative facts.</p>
