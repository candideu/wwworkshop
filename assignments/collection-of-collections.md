# Collection of Collections

For your final project, the task will be to translate a collection into a web-based experience that will be part of a webring called _WWWorkshop_, under the title _Collection of Collections_. As a contributor to the webring you will be documenting and publishing a collection of your choosing that will help form a collective memory with your peers. The exploration of the collection should be engaging, engrossing, and purposeful. Visitors should visit the experience and understand its breadth and connections.

As a starting point there are few questions you could ask yourself before committing to a direction, subject matter, or design:

- What tools/knowledge/methods could we impart to your peers?  
(For example: browser plugins, ways of presenting work quickly, quirks in your neighbourhood for first time visitors)  
- What do you, or friends, collect? and why?  
- What is the web missing?  
- What story can be told through the connections of different items?  
- How do we “query” or “see” specific parts?  
- How do we “browse” or “explore” the whole?  

How you choose to interpret the prompts is up to you. You might have thought of more questions along the way. Your site should have an intent and not simply be a grid of related images, for example. Recall the examples of unique libraries and interpretations of an archive.

Consider your content: one of the central tasks of this assignment is storytelling: but this is not a game or a book, this is a website, a more non-linear form.

Consider the the full breadth of topics, references, and methods we have covered this semester. What is your interpretation of designing, and making, for/on/with the web. Situating *flux*, *user*, *interface*, and *database*.

Know that your sites are not "done" at the due date for this assignment; let's establish a good starting point and allow for your projects to grow and evolve over time. It is encouraged that you think of ways of finding contributions from your peers and your peers peers.

### Requirements
❑ Site should be viewable by anyone with the URL  
❑ Use of an embedded typeface  
❑ All links on page(s) are working  
❑ A page, or dedicated area, that describes your website/collection (About, What is this, Methodology, How to contribute, etc.)  
❑ A .zip file can be uploaded to Canvas (As a backup, or to show process work)  
❑ The webring `<script>` tag snippet below...  

### Adding your site to the webring (Required)
[Webrings on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)

On your homepage, copy and paste the following HTML snippet at the bottom of your page, before the closing `</body>` tag. Optionally, if you have more than one page, paste the HTML snippet on all pages.

Feel free to customize the color of your widget by changing the `data-color` attribute to a color of your choice.

```html
<script src="https://wwworkshop.org/wwwidget.js" data-color="#0000ff" data-link-type="random" async defer></script>
```
_Navigate to a random page in the webring_

**OR**

```html
<script src="https://wwworkshop.org/wwwidget.js" data-color="#0000ff" data-link-type="next" async defer></script>
```
_Navigate to the next page in the webring, adjacent to you_
