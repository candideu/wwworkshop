# Household Objects

To begin to get you comfortable with the use of code to create form, we will start with a simple drawing exercise. This assignment asks you to collect and **draw three objects** from your daily life. Using purely HTML and CSS, draw these objects using only form and counter-form (black and white). You may stylize (simplify) your original object as needed, but the goal is to make a faithful copy of the object. Consider the perspective that you choose for the object.

**AVOID DRAWING THESE OBJECTS: COMPUTERS, CELL-PHONES OR ANY APPLE PRODUCTS.**

**Make sure you use absolute or fixed positioning for all of your elements.**

With CSS3, it is possible to draw non-rectangular shapes right in the browser. Below is a page of CSS3 transformation examples. Edit the CSS on the right to see the shapes change on the left: [css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/).

Here is an example of an object (Ali's bike lock) drawn purely with CSS and HTML: [officehours.codepanel.in/shackle.html](http://officehours.codepanel.in/shackle.html)

Objects be can composed in a single page or multiple `.html` files. If you decide to use a single file, the objects should be noticably different and arranged as a cohesive composition.
