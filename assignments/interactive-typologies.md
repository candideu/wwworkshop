# Interactive Typologies

For the first major assignment for this course you will research and iterate around a key interactive element relating to the desktop browser experience. You will create an abstract website that—not only deploys your assigned interactive element—but finds its ontological center in the element itself.

Through the assignment, you’ll explore the possibilities and limitations of the web as a medium, engage ‘code logic’ as a mode of design thinking, and practice being resourceful and _‘learning on demand.’_

### Final Deliverable

Fully coded website, uploaded to a live server (You have free access to Webspace [via OCAD U](http://webspace.ocad.ca/))

- Site should be viewable by anyone with the URL
- Can be more than one page
- A .zip file can be uploaded to Canvas (As a backup, or to show process work)

You will be assigned an interactive element through the following page—JavaScript is used to randomly assign an element:

[Typologies Randomizer](./interactive-typologies-randomizer)

#### You will be assigned one of these terms

- Hover
- Click
- Drag
- Scroll
- Cursor
- Type
- Show/Hide
- Random

### Your Website Should

- Clearly showcase your assigned browser technology/method
- Use familiar web functionality in an unfamiliar and original way
- Engage and entertain a user/subject
- Be aesthetically adventurous, original, and contemporary
- Actually work (No broken images. No missing libraries. No expectations of that your user imagine a certain behavior)

### Tips

- Think outside of the logic of the ‘skin’, sketch through code, refine your work
- Be formally and conceptually ambitious, technically modest
- Spend your time thinking about how you can make smart and original use of what technical knowledge you already have, rather than trying to learn lots of new stuff
- If an idea proves too technically difficult, figure out a work-around. Don’t get hung up on small problems at the expense of achieving larger goals
- Code isn’t something you learn by heart; it’s something you learn how to Google! Browse forums, GitHub, W3Schools, Code Academy, MDN for answers to your questions
- Share knowledge with your classmates
- Aim to make something really, really awesome
