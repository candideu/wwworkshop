### JavaScript

The production of the assignment may required the use of a JavaScript methods that allow for a operation to be conducted over time. These methods, `setTimeOut` and `setInternal`, look similar but are different in how an operation is exectured.

`setTimeout()` executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds. For example, a `window.alert` is shown, once, after 2 seconds:

```javascript
window.setTimeout(function () {
  window.alert
}, 2000, 'That was really slow!')
```

`setInternal()` executes a function repeatedly. For example, a `window.alert` is shown every 5 seconds:

```javascript
window.setInterval(function () {
  window.alert
}, 5000, 'It has been 5 seconds!')
```

Note on time in JavaScript: Time in JavaScript is usually in milliseconds.
