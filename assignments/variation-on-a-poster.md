Starting with the material provided from **one** of the above content packages, typeset a document with the intent of it being an announcement for the event.

Consider the form, hierarchy, and structure of the page, and how the link(s) on the page relate to the given theme. You must use at least one HTML file. Consider separating content across multiple pages if needed, or directing visitors to a external site for further information. You can start with the boilerplate template below, or with the files above:

[example-1-semantics](../examples/example-1-semantics)

Take note of the text content being presented in relation to the form, typography and navigation of the site. How do people approach the text? What's a unique aspect of the event that could influence how the page is composed? How will you use type to bring life to these texts? The purpose of this assignment is to start developing your skills with the range of typographic tools available in CSS.

**Images** can be added to the page(s), but they should be captioned and attributed to their originating source. This exercise is focused on working with typography on the web and any use of images should be deliberate and not impact the typographic treatment.

**JavaScript** can be added to further develop a concept if needed. It is not a requirement, but is an optional component as we look at its uses in further classes.

**Each document must include:**

❑ At least 3 distinct levels of typographic hierarchy  
❑ A hyperlink to a separate page, or a link to a related external site  
❑ A defined concept related to the selected text  
❑ A consideration towards the structure of your page (Where your elements sit)  
❑ An embedded typeface

You may need to adjust your HTML file as you go along—perhaps you'll need DIVs between sections or you want to target specific things with your stylesheet (consider adding classes to your elements).
